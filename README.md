                                        🚀 WalletRecover Pro — Advanced Bitcoin Wallet Recovery Tool

🔐 Recover Access to Your Lost Bitcoin Wallets
WalletRecover Pro is a high-performance password recovery utility designed for cryptocurrency enthusiasts who have lost access to their Bitcoin wallets due to forgotten passwords or corrupted wallet files. Using optimized multi-threaded scanning and blockchain API integration, the tool systematically tests password combinations against Bitcoin address generation algorithms to locate active wallets.

⚠️ Critical Proxy Requirements
This tool requires SOCKS5 proxies exclusively. Public/free proxies will fail immediately due to aggressive blacklisting by blockchain services.

                                                            ✅ REQUIRED:

Private/residential SOCKS5 proxies with authentication
Minimum 50 unique proxies for scanning >1,000 passwords
Elite anonymity level (no X-Forwarded-For headers)
IP rotation every 50-100 requests

                                                            ❌ PROHIBITED:

Public proxy lists (spys.one, proxyscrape.com, etc.)
HTTP/HTTPS/SOCKS4 protocols
Unauthenticated proxies
Datacenter IPs without rotation

💡 Why? Blockchain APIs (Blockstream.info) maintain real-time blacklists of known proxy IPs. 92% of public proxies are banned within 24 hours of discovery. Only private residential SOCKS5 proxies maintain consistent access.
